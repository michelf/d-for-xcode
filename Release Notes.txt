D for Xcode: Release Notes
==========================

D fox Xcode integrates syntax highlight and code folding for D source files and
integrates the DMD and GDC compilers in the build system.


Known Issues:

*   Debugger support is mostly lacking. You'll be able to see a backtrace of
    mangled function names, but that's all the GNU Debugger is able to see from 
    executables compiled by DMD at this time. Breakpoints are not supported. 
    Executables compiled with GDC might actually be usable for debugging, but 
    this hasn't been tested for a while.

*   Syntax-aware indentation is sometime wrong for constructs which are not present
    in C++/Objective-C, like `foreach`. It's uncertain if this can be fixed. You 
    can disable syntax-aware indentation from Xcode preferences if this bothers you.

*   Code completion isn't done very intelligently at this time. It'll just 
    propose keywords and identifiers found in the same document.

*   There is no indexing support for D source files. It is therefore not possible
    to use jump to definition or similar commands. 


D for Xcode 1.2.2 (28 Mar 2011)

*	Fixed an issue with the directory layout of DMD 2.052.


D for Xcode 1.2.1 (16 Jan 2011)

*	Fixed a link failure complaining about a missing "druntime" library on 
	some systems.

*	Preliminary but very incomplete support for Xcode 4 beta.


D for Xcode 1.2 (21 Mar 2010)

*	Added an installer package. A default install will download and install 
	the latest version of the DMD 2.x and 1.x compiler in /Library/Compilers/.
	
	The installer package will add the proper symbolic links in /usr/local/ 
	to make DMD work properly without fussing with your `PATH` environment 
	variable. The `dmd2` command invokes DMD 2.x while `dmd1` invokes 
	DMD 1.x. `dmd` maps to one of these two (`dmd2` by default but you can 
	change this with `setdmd`).

*	Updated the keyword list for syntax highlighting, improved code folding, 
	and other enhancements in the source scanner.
	
*	Added special scanner code for strings and comments in Xcode 3. Nested 
	comment and all D string syntaxes are now correctly highlighted as strings.

*	D files are now recognized correctly by default in Xcode 3. Previously they
	were assinged the sourcecode.dtrace type (which shares the same file 
	extension); now sourcecode.d takes precedence when files are added to a 
	project. You can manually change the file type from the file info panel 
	in Xcode.

*	Fixed the dependency tree generation which was broken by Xcode 3.1.

*	Got rid of the embedded DMD front end for syntax highlighting, now using 
	a custom lightweight parser for dependency scanning and a custom source 
	scanner for syntax highlighing in Xcode 2.x.

*	Removed support for the outline menu in Xcode 2.x which was using the DMD
	front end and was too time-consuming to keep up to date. The outline is 
	still available in Xcode 3 based on its newer source scanning facilities.


1.1b2 (21 Sep 2008):

*	Improved code folding.

*	Fixed a problem where a wrong linker command was issued under Xcode 3.1.


1.1b1 (31 May 2008):

*	Updated the build process and other parts of the plugin to work with
	Xcode 3 on Leopard. The plugin continue to work with all previously
	supported versions of Xcode (2.4 and 2.5).

*	Created a new set of rules for syntax highlighting suitable for Xcode 3
	and allowing code folding.


1.0.1 (23 Nov 2007)

*	The plugin now registers its launcher application when loaded into Xcode.
	Previously it was counting on the Finder to register it while copying the
	plugin, but that isn't always reliable; hence the need for a backup plan.


1.0 (21 Oct 2007):

Initial release.
