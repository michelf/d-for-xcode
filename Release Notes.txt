D for Xcode: Release Notes
==========================

D fox Xcode integrates syntax highlight and code folding for D source files and
integrates the DMD and GDC compilers in the build system.


Known Issues:

*	The debugger doesn't work with DMD at this point. It can only show you the 
	mangled function names from a stack frame. There is no breakpoint support.

*	For code compiled with GDC, the debugger does not display very well the 
	content of objects.

*	Autocompletion and indexing is not implemented. Autocompletion curently 
	only search for similar words in the same document, which is what Xcode 
	does by default for files it doesn't know about.


1.1b3 (9 Dec 2009):

*	Added support for the DMD compiler. D for Xcode looks at the following 
	paths for DMD:
	
	*	/usr/local/bin/dmd for DMD System Version
	*	/usr/local/bin/dmd1 for DMD 1.x
	*	/usr/local/bin/dmd2 for DMD 2.x
	
	(Note: a DMD installer with this setup remains to be done.)
	
	By default, Xcode projects use the DMD System Version, which can be either 
	D1 or D2. You can change this by going to each target's settings, under the 
	Build Rules tab, and adding a custom build rule for D source files using 
	your prefered compiler.

*	Updated keyword list for syntax highlighting, improved code folding, and 
	other enhancements in the source scanner.
	
*	Added special scanner code for strings and comments in Xcode 3. Nested 
	comment and all D string syntaxes should be highlighted correctly now.

*	D files are now recognized correctly by default in Xcode 3. Previously they
	were assinged the dtrace.sourcecode type (which shares the same file 
	extension); now d.sourcecode takes precedence when files are added to a 
	project. You can manually change the file type from the file info panel 
	in Xcode.

*	Fixed the dependency tree generation under Xcode 3.1.

*	Got rid of the DMD front end, now using a custom lightweight parser for 
	dependency scanning and a source scanner for syntax highlighing in 
	Xcode 2.x.

*	Removed support for the outline menu in Xcode 2.x which was using the DMD
	front end and was too time-consuming to keep up to date. The outline is 
	still available in Xcode 3 using the newer source scanning facilities.


1.1b2 (21 Sep 2008):

*	Improved code folding.

*	Fixed a problem where a wrong linker command was issued under Xcode 3.1.


1.1b1 (31 May 2008):

*	Updated the build process and other parts of the plugin to work with
	Xcode 3 on Leopard. The plugin continue to work with all previously
	supported versions of Xcode (2.4 and 2.5).

*	Created a new set of rules for syntax highlighting suitable for Xcode 3
	and allowing code folding.


1.0.1 (23 Nov 2007)

*	The plugin now registers its launcher application when loaded into Xcode.
	Previously it was counting on the Finder to register it while copying the
	plugin, but that isn't always reliable; hence the need for a backup plan.


1.0 (21 Oct 2007):

Initial release.
