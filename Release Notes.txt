D for Xcode: Release Notes
==========================

Known Issues:

*	Nested comments and documentation comments are ignored by the syntax
	highlighter in Xcode 3.

*	Files with the .d extensions are given the "sourcecode.dtrace" type
	instead of "sourcecode.d" while first added to a project. This is because
	Xcode already has a rule associating .d files with dtrace which takes
	precedence. You must open the info panel for your files and manually select
	the "sourcecode.d" file type. This does not apply to Xcode 2.x.

*	The debugger doesn't demangle function names. This can probably be fixed
	by patching GDB.

*	The debugger does not show very intelligently the content of objects.


1.1b2 (21 Sep 2008):

*	Improved code folding.

*	Fixed a problem where a wrong linker command was issued under Xcode 3.1.


1.1b1 (31 May 2008):

*	Updated the build process and other parts of the plugin to work with
	Xcode 3 on Leopard. The plugin continue to work with all previously
	supported versions of Xcode (2.4 and 2.5).

*	Created a new set of rules for syntax highlighting suitable for Xcode 3
	and allowing code folding.


1.0.1 (23 Nov 2007)

*	The plugin now registers its launcher application when loaded into Xcode.
	Previously it was counting on the Finder to register it while copying the
	plugin, but that isn't always reliable; hence the need for a backup plan.


1.0 (21 Oct 2007):

Initial release.
